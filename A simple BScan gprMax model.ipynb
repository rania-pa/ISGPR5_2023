The process of designing the model is almost the same with the exception of specifying the *starting* locations of the transmitter and receiver and then the steps that gprMax will use in subsequent runs to move them in order to generate the simulated scan data one trace at the time. Obviously, the targets do not move!"

We also will assume that there are no boundaries to this model for our waves and so absorbing boundaries are used by default around the edges of our numerical grid.\n",
